		<h4>
		<i>As close as a <b>brother </b>and then 
		a <b>friend </b>,your brother will always 
		be one of the most helpful person in your 
		life.
		</i></h4><br/><br/>
		A birthday is just the beginning of another 
		year in that thing they call life. It is 
		long and sometimes beautiful, other times 
		difficult, but it’s made all the better since
		 I have a Sister like you. I hope that I can 
		 bring you that same comfort. Every birthday 
		 is a new page in your book of life. Make sure
		  to fill your pages with generosity, kindness,
		   and love.<br/><br/>
		
		<b><u><h2>Happy Birthday.</h2></u></b> 
		<br/><br/>
		To My <b>Sister</b>, Woohoo! It’s your 
		day! Go crazy and enjoy it! I can’t wait
		 to see what wonderful things life 
		 brings you this next year.
		<br/><br/>
		I’m wishing you the most scrumptious and 
		delightful birthday ever!
		<br/><br/>
		My happiness is having you in my long life
		  journey. In you, <b>Sister </b>and<b> 
		  Best friend </b>both were rolled up into
		   one! Stay wild and have a fantastic 
		   day!<br/><br/>
		
		I know I’m wishing you too late.<br/>
		Did you wait for my wishing?<br/>
		I guess no!<br/>
		18th October, 2002. <br/>
		You came into the world with the peace of
		 heaven.<br/>
		You lighted your mother's lap.<br/>
		Wish your journey to the high may reach 
		to your goal.<br/>
		Keep smiling always. <br/>
		Because, it suits you very much.<br/>
		The Moon of your face what you can see 
		when you stand in front of miror.<br/>
		The Sun don’t need to shine in the 
		morning, make your morning shine with 
		your refreshing silence.<br/>
		Fight for your justice.<br/>
		Learn about yourself.<br/>
		Don’t let others know about your weakness.<br/>
		Hide your scary, show your brave to 
		everyone.<br/>
		The world is a mystery! The world is 
		freedom! The world is jealous about 
		you! The world is dream! The world is 
		reality! The whole world will put you down.<br/>
		Notice, from where you get importance.<br/>
		<br/>
		A freindship what you had made with me,
		 Unfortunately its broken.<br/>
		<br/>
		No matter what it was happend but I’m 
		still on my promise.<br/>
		I don’t care what you think about but 
		still i can remember the memories.<br/>
		I can remember the memories what was 
		made with you.<br/>
		Really, I don’t need any excuse!<br/>
		Always tell the truth, judge the 
		present, think about the future.<br/>
		<br/>
		At last, be happy and spread happiness.<br/>
		Keep smiling all time.<br/>
		<br/>
		Wish your long lives.<br/>
		Live a century.<br/>
		Live thousands year in every persons 
		memory.<br/>
		Live laks year. <br/>
		And live well.<br/>
		Be happy now and always.<br/>
		<br/>
		Happy Birthday again,<br/><br/>
